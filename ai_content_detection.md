# Heuristics to Identify AI-Written Social Media Posts

## Part 1: Heuristics Identifiable Using Regex and String Matching

These patterns can be detected using simple pattern matching, regular expressions, and basic text analysis without requiring AI/ML models:

### Structural & Formatting Patterns

**Excessive Use of Em Dashes (‚Äî)**: Count occurrences of em dashes (‚Äî) relative to text length. ChatGPT (especially GPT-4) overuses em dashes to connect clauses. A ratio of more than 1 em dash per 100 words is suspicious.
- Regex: `‚Äî` or `\u2014`
- Pattern: Multiple em dashes in short text blocks

**Bullet Point and List Addiction**: Detect frequent use of bullet points, numbered lists, and emoji bullets (‚úÖ, üöÄ, ‚ùå, ‚ú®, ‚≠ê).
- Regex: `^[\s]*[‚Ä¢\-\*]\s`, `^\s*\d+\.\s`, `^[\s]*[‚úÖ‚ùåüöÄ‚ú®‚≠êÔ∏è]\s`
- Pattern: Lists with emoji bullets, especially alternating ‚ùå (problems) and ‚úÖ (solutions)

- Regex: Count hashtags and identify overly broad ones

**Formulaic Call-to-Actions**: Detect standard engagement prompts.
- Exact matches: "Let's continue the conversation!", "What do you think?", "Agree or disagree?"

### Grammar and Punctuation Patterns

**Perfect Grammar (Too Clean)**: Analyze for absence of common human errors.
- Pattern: Zero spelling mistakes, perfect punctuation
- Check for common typos that are suspiciously absent

**Consistent Punctuation Style**: Detect overly consistent comma usage, apostrophes, etc.
- Pattern: Never mixing punctuation styles (always Oxford comma, consistent quote marks)

- Pattern: Repeated use of three-item lists or constructions
- Regex: Detect patterns like "X, Y, and Z" structures appearing frequently
- Examples: "Just me, a thing, and a whimsical third thing"

**Repetitive Phrase Usage**: AI lacks typical human aversion to repetition and may repeat the same phrase multiple times.
- Pattern: Same phrase appearing 2+ times in short text
- String matching: Exact phrase repetition detection
- Example: Using "wild, right?" multiple times

**Common GPT Transition Phrases**: Specific transition patterns ChatGPT uses frequently.
- Phrases: "But here's the thing", "And [topic]? Wow", "So yeah", "Additionally,", "Furthermore,", "Moreover,"

**"So" Paragraph Beginnings**: Predictable "So" paragraphs near the end.
- Pattern: Paragraphs starting with "So" especially in conclusions
- Regex: `^So\s` at paragraph beginnings

**Filler Question Constructions**: Rhetorical questions that add no value.
- Pattern: "What does this mean?", "Why does this matter?", "How do we fix this?"
- Often followed immediately by the answer

**Overuse of Quotation Marks for Emphasis**: AI uses quotes incorrectly for emphasis rather than actual quotations.

- Phrases: "leverage synergies", "paradigm shift", "game changer", "revolutionary"
- Pattern: Buzzword density higher than normal conversation

## Part 2: Heuristics Requiring GenAI or Advanced Analysis

These patterns require semantic understanding, context analysis, or AI models to detect effectively:

### Content & Meaning Analysis

**Lack of Personal Voice or Fingerprint**: Detecting unique writing style requires semantic analysis of personality markers, humor patterns, and individual quirks that can't be captured by simple pattern matching.

**Emotionally Tone-Deaf Content**: Understanding when enthusiasm is inappropriate for the topic or when emotional responses don't match the context requires contextual AI analysis.

**Generic or Shallow Content**: Determining content depth and meaningfulness requires understanding subject matter and context beyond simple pattern matching.

**Lack of Personal Anecdotes**: Distinguishing between generic examples and genuine personal experiences requires understanding narrative structure and authenticity markers.

### Tone and Style Analysis

**Overly Consistent "Monotone" Tone**: Detecting emotional variation and natural human voice modulation requires sentiment analysis and tonal understanding.

**Too "Neat" and Polished**: Understanding natural human writing flow versus mechanical transitions requires stylistic analysis.

**Avoidance of Strong Opinions**: Detecting hedging behavior and opinion strength requires sentiment and stance analysis.

**Unnatural Formality Levels**: Understanding appropriate register for context requires sociolinguistic analysis.

### Semantic and Contextual Analysis

**Unrelatable or Odd Examples**: Evaluating whether analogies and examples fit contextually requires domain knowledge and semantic understanding.

**Missing Context or Logical Gaps**: Detecting coherence issues and logical flow problems requires understanding argument structure.

**Factual Errors Stated Confidently**: Requires fact-checking against knowledge bases and understanding confidence levels.

**Off-Topic Responses**: Understanding whether content matches the intended topic requires semantic similarity analysis.

### Advanced Linguistic Patterns

**Lack of Contractions and Informal Language**: While contractable phrases can be detected with regex, understanding when informality is expected requires contextual analysis.

**Unnatural Conversation Flow**: In comment threads or dialogues, detecting unnatural response patterns requires conversation analysis.

**Cultural and Contextual Appropriateness**: Understanding whether language choices fit the cultural context requires cultural knowledge models.

**Subtle Semantic Repetition**: While exact repetition can be caught with string matching, detecting when the same idea is expressed in different words requires semantic similarity analysis.

### Model-Specific Behavioral Patterns

**ChatGPT's Hedging Behavior**: Understanding patterns of uncertainty expression and risk-averse language requires understanding model behavior.

**Balanced Viewpoint Tendency**: Detecting artificial "on one hand, on the other hand" structures requires understanding argumentation patterns.

**Response to Controversial Topics**: Understanding how AI models handle sensitive topics differently from humans requires content analysis.

## Implementation Notes for Part 1 (Regex/String Matching)

When implementing these heuristics in Python:

1. **Create scoring functions** for each pattern (0-1 scores work well)
2. **Use weighted combinations** - some patterns are stronger indicators than others
3. **Consider text length** - normalize counts by document length
4. **Build pattern libraries** - maintain lists of common AI phrases, emoji patterns, etc.
5. **Use fuzzy matching** for slight variations of common phrases
6. **Count ratios** rather than absolute numbers (em-dashes per 100 words, etc.)
7. **Look for pattern clusters** - multiple weak signals together make a strong case

The regex/string matching approach will catch the most obvious AI-generated content, while the more sophisticated patterns in Part 2 require semantic analysis to detect effectively.
